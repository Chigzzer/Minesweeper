 # Description
 A small project I wanted to work on in order to get a better understanding of recursion and event listeners; while further developing my JavaScript and HTML skills.

 A simple copy of the old school Minesweeper game. User has the ability to choose 3 different levels of difficulty. The user can flag and un-flag cells to alert where they think bombs are. A flag counter which auto updates is present on the web page and once all the flags have been used; the player can click a auto complete button to fill in all the non-flagged squares.

 If the player selects a empty square, one that is not next to a bomb, it will ripple around till all empty squares. Checks are made in the backend to confirm all flags are used prior the autofill button functioning. 

# WHat could be improved
- Responsiveness of the site to other media mediums.
- Container's and squares adapting to web page zoom.
- Custom game: custom pad size and grid size.
    - Custom sub menu

# What I Learnt
* The use of Z-axis to choose the stack order of elements on the page
    * To be able to click the square rather than the flag element.
* How to pass the event to an external function.
* The ability to use one liner in 'if' statements.
* Loop tags
* How to do a basic overlay of items using negative margins.
* Understanding of let and constant variables and the location.
* Difference in small features between FIrefox and Chrome. 
* Use of custom attributes - 'data-*'
